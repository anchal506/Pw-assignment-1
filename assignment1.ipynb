    "Q3. Explain the use of the following operators using an example:\n",
    "(i) /\n",
    "Ans- operator \"/\" is the division operator. It is used to divide one number by another and obtain the quotient as the result. For example:\n",
    "    a = 10\n",
    "    b = 3\n",
    "result = a / b\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) %\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The operator \"%\" is the modulo operator or the remainder operator. It returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "a = 10\n",

    "(iii) //\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The operator \"//\" is the floor division operator. It performs integer division and returns the floor value of the quotient. The floor value is the largest integer that is less than or equal to the quotient. For example:\n",

Once an immutable object is created, any operation that appears to modify the object actually creates a new object with the modified value. This property ensures that the original object remains unchanged.\n",
